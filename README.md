### Hello out there ðŸ‘‹

I spent most of my available time, beside family and job, to make IoT easier to use for everyone - using Node.js, TypeScript and JavaScript.

I'm one of the core developers of the smart home automation software [ioBroker](https://iobroker.net). Beside working on the central component [js-controller](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.js-controller) I try to maintain over 200 adapters/plugins in the [ioBroker Organization](https://github.com/ioBroker) and in the [Community Adapter Organization](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/info) together with some other developers. Additionally to this I support the ioBroker project as Project manager for core topics and bigger releases and coordinate the work in the community and communication channels like [Forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/3W9m8dnf) and Telegram.
With all this work my goal is to deliver best possible quality for the users and community members and make the life easier and more convenient for all ioBroker developers.

One of m current main focus topics is to build, maintain and lead the [JavaScript/TypeScript library for the Matter protocol](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js) to allow the JavaScript community build devices and controllers for the new Matter smart home standard.

Furthermore I also maintain some own ioBroker adapters and some Libraries to bring IoT protocols into the Node.js world. I always try to develop libraries that are usable by all JS/TS developers out there. E.g. I do maintain projects to interact with [Amazon Alexa Devices](https://github.com/Apollon77/alexa-remote/), [Daikin Devices](https://github.com/Apollon77/daikin-controller), [Daikin Cloud Devices](https://github.com/Apollon77/daikin-controller-cloud), [MBus devices](https://github.com/Apollon77/node-mbus), [Meross Devices](https://github.com/Apollon77/meross-cloud/), [Smartmeters](https://github.com/Apollon77/smartmeter-obis/) and last but not least [HomeKit HAP Controller](https://github.com/Apollon77/hap-controller-node/) and I also co-maintain and contribute libraries for some other protocols like [Coap](https://github.com/mcollina/node-coap).
